### Usage
Choose an image or video. It will be set to start by default. Press stop to change it.<br>
Image will be overlayed when Discord is the active window.<br>
To position image drag it with mouse to a desired place. Relative distance to the picked anchor will be used for future placement.<br>
Scale setting allows to size the image down if needed.
##### User settings
Your settings will be saved for future sessions and will load automatically without need to do it manually.<br>
So to use your previous setup you dont need to start anything, just run the app itself and enjoy your Discord.
##### Suggestion
You can replace Discord launch shortcut with the provided .bat file to start the overlay app alongside Discord. Just change the paths to files in the .bat file.
